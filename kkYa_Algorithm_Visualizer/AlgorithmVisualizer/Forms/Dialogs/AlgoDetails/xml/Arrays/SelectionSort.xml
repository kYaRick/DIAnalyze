    <description>
        An in-place sorting algorithm. Selection sort sorts the array by dividing
        the array into 2 parts, 1 sorted and the other is not, initially the sorted
        part is empty and the algorithm terminates when the sorted part is the entire array.
        Selection sort selects the min/max in each pass and places it at the correct position,
        causing the sorted part to increase by 1 and the unsorted part to decrease by 1.
        Selection sort has quadratic runtime even in the best case, however it makes the minimum
        possible number of swaps, n-1 swaps in the worst case.
