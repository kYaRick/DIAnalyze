    <description>
        A simple sorting algorithm where the array is being scanned and adjacent elements
        are comapred and swapped if found out of order. The algorithm is named for the way
        smaller/larger elements "bubble" to the start/end of the array. This simple algorithm
        performs poorly for large data sets and real world data and is primarily used for
        educational purposes. The best case runtime can be brought down to O(n) from O(n^2) by checking
        after every array pass if there were swaps, if not then the array is sorted.
        the best case runtime occours when the input array is already sorted. Bubble sort is an
        in-place, stable sorting algorithm.
