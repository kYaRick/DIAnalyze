    <description>
        An in-place, stable sorting algorithm that sorts the array one item at a time.
        The algorithm in quadratic in the worst case and therefore inefficient for large
        data sets however, the algorithm is quite efficient for small data sets, much like
        other quadratic sorting algorithms. Moreover the algorithm is efficient for sorted
        or partially sorted data sets, for already sorted data sets the runtime is O(n) and
        is also the best case, when each element in the array is no more than k places away
        from its sorted position the runtime can be bounded by O(k*n).
